## Project Description

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to the Markdown Note Taking App. I'm just your regular student who found taking notes a tad too dull and decided to amp it up a bit. This project brings together a bunch of technologies I love: SvelteKit, Tauri, and AI functionalities. The main star🌟, however, is its WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Markdown editing. This way, note-taking becomes smoother and way cooler.

## Roadmap
Currently brewing in the code cauldron🧙‍♂️:
